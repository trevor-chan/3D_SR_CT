patch sampling
- desired voxel size of 0.2mm
- high res imag along z axis: 0.033mm
- 96 slices in the patch
- 0.2 * 96 / 0.033 = 582 slices ~ 96 voxel size

- load high res images at matrix size of x * y * 582 slices
- downsample to the desrired voxel size, 0.2mm, at the factor of 0.2 / 0.033
- then slice patches 96 * 96 * 96
- overlap: 32 voxels

- move along high res z axis, shift down by 64 voxels
- save all slices locally


data augmentation
- corpping
- downsample, upsample the 3d volume
    - at factor from 2 to 5, (e.g. 0.2 -> 0.4 -> 0.2), uniform sampling
    - happen after cropping - save some time
